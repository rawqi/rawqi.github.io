In today's lesson we did some work with google's spreadsheet. We made a table for running a shop in terms of having; stock, price, quantity etc. We used some functions such as VLOOKUP and IFerror. VLOOKUP looks up a certain piece of information in a vertical column hence V. IFerror is a basic function which lets you do something else if there is an error. The code for this =iferror(vlookup(E2,$A$2:$B$60,2,false),) Below is an image of my spreadsheet.
