Exploring github furhter...


In today's lesson I looked into how to embed photos and video. Although I had done this in the past, I found an easier method and how to change certain aspects of the embedded video or photo such as size. I also troubleshooters some errors in style.scss. This was caused by an invalid font type ($Courier) so I corrected those errors and then the site worked. I also learned that the site may take 5/10 minutes to refresh so I didn't worry if my changes didn't show up yet. Also being my first lesson on GitHub this year I had to refresh myself as to where certain elements where located but I quickly remembered how to change certain things such as the favicon.

Below you can see my spreadsheet so far.
