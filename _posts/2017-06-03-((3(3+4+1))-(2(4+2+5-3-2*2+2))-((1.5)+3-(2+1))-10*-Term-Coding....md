  <tr>
    <td>Day 1:
I finished the PYG Latin course and it took me AGES! It got really difficult about half way through, but I tried several ways of going around the problem until I got the right answers….</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Day 2: 
I started doing "Functions" and at first it seemed quite easy. After that though, I had to really persevere and thoroughly read the instructions to to get the right answer.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Day 3: 
I carried on doing functions from 23% to 26%. I found it more easy then last time as I had familiarized myself with how to do the different functions...</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Day 4: 
I started on 26% and now I am on 33%, and I finished the function course... It got fairly hard but I ended up having a break and them coming back to it with the answer. I think that overall I am now very comfortable with this type of python coding. </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Day 5:
I started on 33% and now I am on 38%, and I have finished the Taking a vacation course… I started doing the Lists and Dictionaries course but I only did 2 because I had already done 45 mins of work… (Because of the vacation course) </td>
