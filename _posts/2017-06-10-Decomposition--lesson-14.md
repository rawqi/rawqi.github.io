    <td>We started by sir asking us how to make a cup of tea. The point of the exercise was to be precise with what you say and not to make assumptions. Decomposition is a good way of life and that way you will be successful.
We learnt the different "gates" i.e. Or gate and And gates. And gates mean both inputs have to be true, to output true.  
I also learnt that computers ONLY work in yes and no or 1 and 0</td>
