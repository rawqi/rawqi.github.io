    <td>After making sure that I had done all the work necessary for me to do, I went around the classroom, helping others. I helped multiple people such as I helped Sonny learn which buttons moved which part of the robot arm. I helped Harvey make his robot arm work as he hadn't quite got some of his code right and I helped Felix film him maneuvering the robot arm.</td>

    <td>I would have had a video today, and it would have had really good edits, (ask Finn OB, or Harvey,) but everything on my iPad got wiped accidently (by me) so I lost all of my footage. (That was 69.8 GB of photos and videos, and 58.2 GB of other stuff lost!! ;(</td>
